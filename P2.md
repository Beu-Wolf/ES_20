Note: The teardown group also checks the number of approved/rejected questions. This has to be done after all the teacher evaluations and before the data removal from the database. Making these tasks in a separate Thread group would conflict with the evaluation (in a normal thread group) or with the teardown (in a teardown thread group);

From the `Profiling Percentages`, it is clear that most of the time is spent on `getMaxClarificationRequestKey`. Moreover load test on WSsubmitClarificationRequest, reveled that most requests where being denied (for tetsing purposes we changed it to pass the `key` on the `HTTP Request Body`). Therefore, we decided to refactor the creation of a `ClarificationRequest` by delaying the atribution of a `key` until it is strictly necessary.
