**Note**: The teardown group also checks the number of approved/rejected questions. This has to be done after all the teacher evaluations and before the data removal from the database. Making these tasks in a separate Thread group would conflict with the evaluation (in a normal thread group) or with the teardown (in a teardown thread group);

#### Discussion of findings

For F1, it is clear that most of the time (96.5%) is spent querying the database for the max key to use, which is not critical since a question creation doesn't happen a lot and it doesn't take too much time to accomplish individually.
For F2, querying the database takes the majority of the time (67.4%/71.3%), but it is necessary so as to find the correct question to evaluate.
As for F3, the issue is the same with around 99% of time used in the database, which is also necessary to identify the correct user to show his questions.

#### Discussion of findings

From the `Profiling Percentages`, it is clear that most of F1's execution time is spent on `getMaxClarificationRequestKey`. Moreover, the load test on `WSsubmitClarificationRequest`, revealed that most requests where being denied (for testing purposes we changed it to pass the `key` on the `HTTP Request Body`). Therefore, we decided to refactor the creation of a `ClarificationRequest` by delaying the atribution of a `key` until it is strictly necessary. With this modification, there were no more conflicts and tests that took 13' to run, now take 30s.
